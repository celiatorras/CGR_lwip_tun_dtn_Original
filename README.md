# DTN-Enabled IPv6 Implementation

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project implements the architecture proposed in "Leveraging IPv6 and ICMPv6 for Delay-Tolerant Networking in Deep Space" by Pirovano et al. It demonstrates how to integrate DTN (Delay-Tolerant Networking) functionalities directly into IPv6 using custom ICMPv6 messages and hop-by-hop extension headers, enabling store-and-forward capabilities while maintaining full IPv6 compatibility.

The implementation uses a modified version of the LwIP (Lightweight IP) stack in userspace with a TUN interface to intercept and process packets. DTN-aware nodes can store packets during network disruptions and forward them when connectivity is restored.

## KEY FEATURES

- **Store-and-Forward**: Persistent packet storage for handling network disruptions
- **Custom ICMPv6 Signaling**: DTN status reporting (RECEIVED, FORWARDED, DELIVERED, DELETED)
- **Contact-Based Routing**: Schedule-aware routing for intermittent connectivity
- **Custody Transfer**: Optional hop-by-hop reliability mechanism
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate controller, routing and storage functions

## ARCHITECTURE

The implementation consists of:
- **DTN Module**: Core functionality with controller, routing and storage functions
- **Custom LwIP**: Modified lightweight IP stack for userspace packet processing
- **TUN Interface**: Intercepts packets from kernel to userspace
- **Raw Sockets**: Direct packet transmission bypassing kernel routing

## COMPILING AND RUNNING THE PROJECT

Inside the lwip-tun-dtn directory

```bash     
make clean
make 
sudo ./lwip_tun
```

The current configuration is set to run on a node with the following characteristics:

– fd00:01::2 (enp0s9) — Interface connecting to a neighbor Node
– fd00:12::1 (enp0s8) — Interface connecting to another neighbor Node
– fd00::1 (tun0) — TUN interface for kernel-userspace communication
– fd00::2 — lwIP/DTN userspace address
- Two raw sockets connected to interfaces enp0s8 and enp0s9
- Scheduled contact for a node with address fd00:33::2

For deployment on nodes/environments with other characteristics, all corresponding configurations in this project have to be adjusted. Namely:

- dtn_controller.h/c
- dtn_routing.h/c
- main.c
- raw_socket.h/c

For deployment, the interfaces accessed by the lwIP/DTN userpace module have to exist and be configured on the system. Moreover, the environment has to be configured to forward all traffic towards the address of the lwIP/DTN userpace module (fd00::2) over the tun interface fd00::1 (tun0).

## CUSTOM ICMPV6 MESSAGES

| 200 | DTN-PCK-RECEIVED | Packet received by DTN node |
| 201 | DTN-PCK-FORWARDED | Packet forwarded to next hop |
| 202 | DTN-PCK-DELIVERED | Packet reached final destination |
| 203 | DTN-PCK-DELETED | Packet deleted from storage |
